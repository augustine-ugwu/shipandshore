                quantifiable expertise in the chartering and management of
                vessels and tugboats and offshore operations over the past

                our acquired knowledge, skill experience can be clearly seen in
                our proven achievements such that we can be considered a major

                by the Oil Marketing Companies and the Pipelines & Products
                Marketing Company Limited. It is our mission to continue to
                improve our performance in order to maintain the leadership
                position hitherto achieved through dedication and efficient
