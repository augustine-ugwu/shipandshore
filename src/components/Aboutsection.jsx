                player in the Nigerian Shipping/Oil & Gas industry. Following
                the need for transportation of petroleum products by the
                Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in the early
                1990, the company was one of the pioneer that supplied the NNPC
                coastal vessel on charter for the transportation of refined
                petroleum products AGO, LPFO and PMS from the refineries at
                Portharcourt and Warri and also lightering import vessels
                through Ship to Ship (STS) transfer and discharge at storage
                facilities in the Lagos area. Over the years- 35 years, the
                company has had the privilege of providing vessels and tugboats
                to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Ship &
                Shore Services Limited based on her pedigree, technical and
